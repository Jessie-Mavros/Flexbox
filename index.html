        <div class='answer'>I always tend to write a lot more than I should when it comes to essay assignments, so I don't want to say that I will take the minimum approach and will more than likely end up with the middle road. But those are what I will probably be focusing on, though I don't know the exact topic yet.</div>

          <div class='question'>Group Project</div>
          <div class='answer'>Our group project is working the backgrounds of places and characters as they pertain to the manga/anime Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood. Given that we have five people working on this and there are five places on the map, we are splitting up the work that way and I chose perhaps the more wordy part, the East City. I don't feel too confident with the coding in this class, so I am fully prepared to take the minimum approach to this. However, I would like to add more pictures and such on my part of the project, which could result in the middle road.</div>

             <div class='question'>Individual Project</div>
             <div class='answer'>I have a feeling that this will also be more middle ground but has potential to go the maximum route. Of course, I don't know exactly what I'm doing yet, but I know in our World Building class I tried some experimentation in the assignments there and really enjoyed the challenge, so I think I will also enjoy the challenge of putting something into a technology form other than print, such as video or audio or something of the like that can be published online.</div>
